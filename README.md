( it was supposted to be psychological horror and monsters in the story were supposted to be embodiments of human traumas / fears / mental illnesses )

THIS IS THE PART OF THE STORY IT WAS BASED ON

THE SECOND CREW — CALLED: "PROMETHEANS"

Among them was Elizabeth Mire, linguist and psychological analyst, and her partner, Dr. Callen Vire, an exo-neurobiologist. The two had studied Deula for years. Obsessed with the silence from the Divine Elodion. When they arrived in orbit, something was already wrong. The planet was no longer just rock and dust — it pulsed, like it remembered them.

Within 3 days, two Promethean members were missing and by day 6, Elizabeth vanished...

She was last seen stepping into a corridor that looped back on itself. No sounds. No warnings. Just .."Elizabeth was gone." The door she passed through no longer existed. All cameras failed.

THE LOVER’S DESCENT
The crew got imidiete order to leave the orbit after all those bizzare events that happend..
But Callen refused to leave wanting to find out what happend to his lover.
He descended alone into the surface where the Elodion wreckage — where impossible echoes whispered in his own voice. He found one of her gloves, soaked in blood and folded into a perfect origami swan.

He never came back.

But something else did
[New entity got disscovered]
Class: Torment
Given name: Lamentor 
Psyhical Status: Irrecoverable

Once a man of science, now a walking cathedral of grief. The Lamentor takes the shape of an open ribcage, hollow and echoing with Elizabeth’s voice — though she is no longer there. It doesn’t chase. It waits. Those who see it feel overwhelming guilt, sorrow, and the need to confess… before they vanish.

Quote: "She’s still talking to me. I just have to stay quiet so I can hear her better."
Traits:

Wears her voice like clothing.

Glitches cameras by simply being remembered.

Causes hallucinations of lost loved ones by simply manipulating sounds with his ribcage
